# Contentity

This repository implements a web application framework and
deployment system for web sites running under Apache/mod_perl.

The first version was written around 2004 as an amalgamation of
existing CPAN modules, unpublished Open Source modules I had written
to process web forms, and various other bits of application specific
code that I had written for a number of commercial clients.  It has
been actively developed and extended over the last 18 years and
continues to be used as the framework for several production web
sites.

It has never been released to CPAN, and probably never will be.
It is not even "officially" Open Source software.  However you
are welcome to use it or adapt it for you own needs, but be warned
that it is not actively maintained and does not come with any
guarantee of fitness for purpose.  It is a framework that I built
to help *me* build and maintain website for paying clients.  Feel
free to contact me if you would like to discuss a support contract.

If you are looking to build a web application framework in Perl then
[Mojolicious](https://www.mojolicious.org/) is a great place to start.
